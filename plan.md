# Blix — the current plan

Stages A–E of the portability and input arc are done and merged (PRs #37–#39).
Their reasoning lives where it governs behaviour — code comments, `docs/`, and the
suites that pin it — rather than here, per conventions §9. What follows is what is
still open, and nothing else.

---

## F — a body in the character room

The one stage not started. `src/Demos/Character/` holds a shared library — room,
motor, camera, renderer, resolver — with `room` (walk it), `room-shot` (capture it)
and a probe (87 assertions, headless) over it.

**The prerequisite nothing listed: there is no body.** The room draws a capsule and
has zero references to `ClipPlayer`, `AnimationClip` or `Pose`. Every consumer of
`BoneMask` and `RootMotion` in the tree is a tool, a test or the preview tool — none
is a character that moves. So "contact drives weights" is not two existing things
being wired together.

**It is a sibling executable**, `Blix.Demos.Character.Body`, over the same library.
That is what the collection's shape is for, and it keeps `room` answering the
question it already answers. The body takes the room's geometry and motor from the
library; what it adds is a rig on top of the capsule.

**First observable, and the whole of the first step:** a skinned Rogue standing in
the room, facing the right way, feet on the floor. Nothing blended, nothing masked.
The unknown is the rig fit against a 0.35 m radius, 1.8 m capsule, and it should
surface on its own rather than tangled in a blending design.

Then, and only once a body walks:

**Contact drives weights, and there are no states.** Speed and groundedness come out
of the resolver and drive blend weights directly — no states, no transitions, no
dwell timers. `BoneMask`'s first consumer that is not a tool: locomotion on the legs,
a one-shot on the upper body. The Rogue carries what this needs — `Walking_A/B/C`,
`Running_A/B`, `Idle`, `Unarmed_Melee_Attack_Punch_A/B`.

*Negative control:* the mask set to `All` must visibly break the legs, and set to
`None` must leave the walk bit-for-bit unchanged. A layer that changes nothing and a
layer that changes everything are a mask's two failures, and both are invisible
unless asked for.

**And then the clip drives the contact.** Root motion says how far, the room says
where you can go. Honest expectation: 4 travelling clips of 76, so this may end a
**decided-no**, and reaching that with the instrument built is the output.

**Acceptance is from the chair.** Walk the room: ramps, stairs, ledges, walls. Every
stage of this arc had at least one fault only a person watching could see, and four
of five were **legibility, not mechanism**.

## Acceptance steps that are access, not work

These keep this record open. None can be closed by writing anything.

**No clean Mac has run a published bundle.** Every stage-B measurement was taken on
the machine that built it. "Zero images mapped from `/opt/homebrew`" is the strongest
available proxy and is not the test. Take a `.app` to a Mac with no Homebrew, no
.NET, no Vulkan SDK and no OpenAL, and launch it.

**A `win-x64` publish ships no OpenAL native.** `vulkan-1.dll` is correctly absent —
the GPU driver installs it — but OpenAL Soft is neither a system library nor in a
NuGet runtime pack. Stage B's closure question, unanswered for Windows.

**No physical gamepad has been held.** The lifetime is proven against the state
machine; the Silk seam is not. Specifically unverified: that thumbstick index 0/1 is
left/right on a real device, and that a resting trigger now reads 0.00 rather than
1.00 — the direct observable of the range fix. `blix run Chassis --frames 900` prints
the lifetime lines; plug and unplug.

**`blix.cmd` is only as verified as CI exercises it**, and the Windows branch of the
native build targets has only ever run on a GitHub runner.

---

## Known gaps that are not scheduled

**`demos` has a gate of one probe.** Eleven demos are still verified by being run and
looked at, which is right for a demo. Future experiments append to that line; the
gate growing is a consequence, not a plan.

**The `demos` gate is not in CI.** The workflow runs the root gate only. Closing it
is one step in `ci.yml` — deliberately not taken here rather than slipped in.

**Linux is absent from the CI matrix.** A second red job teaches nothing the first
has not; the shape of what Windows needed should be known before it is copied.

## Deferred until something asks

Probe density, `BakeMerge`, clip-lookup-by-name, further `PropModel` adoption.
Each waits for a consumer, which is conventions §5 and §8, and waiting does not keep
a plan record open. The probe-density measurements and the approaches already refuted
are in [`docs/renderer.md`](docs/renderer.md) so the same ground is not walked twice.
